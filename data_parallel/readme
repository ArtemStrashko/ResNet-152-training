Run MFlow Tracking using the following command in a separate terminal. As soon as you start MLflow, VSCode will create a port forwarding tunnel, so you can access the remote MLflow server on your local machine.

```
mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:////home/ubuntu/mlruns.db --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001
```
